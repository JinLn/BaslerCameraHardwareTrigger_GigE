# BaslerCameraHardwareTrigger_GigE
Basler Camera using hardware trigger
# Description
This is a simple program used for grabbing image from a Basler USB3 camera, trigger signal generated by Arduino microcontroller

# Dependencies
1.OpenCV3

2.Pylon SDK

--OpenCV3 is used for display image grabbed and write image to disk
In case you don't want to display images or you have your own function for writing image to disk, please feel free to disable OpenCV part

--Pylon SDK
Since we are using Basler camera, Pylon SDK must be installed on your system

Please follow the instruction from Pylon documentation
Documentation could be found here https://www.baslerweb.com/en/products/software/basler-pylon-camera-software-suite/, select the documentation correpond with your own camera model  e.g. I'm using Basler acA1300-200um
